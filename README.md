# MNIST-Digit-Classification
Neural Network for detecting handwritten Digits using Deep Learning 

the MNIST data set is already preprocessed and is available in the TensorFlow dataset library

some data explaoration to understand the data better
a new dataset was created by inverting the color of the original data to improve identification with different background and writing styles

a neural network model implemented using 3 hidden layers with ReLU activation function and softmax for the output layer consisting of 10 outputs 0-9
(the structure of the model can be changed and tweaked to try to get better accuracy)

A confusion matrix was used to identify the performance of the model in more detail.

selected an individual number and predicted the output.

developed a simple system which can be used to input any images and let the model try and identify the Digit
